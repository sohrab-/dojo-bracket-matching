What went well
---

* We solved the problem :) 
* Excellent collaboration among pairs and the team in general
* It was very engaging - most people got to have a go 
* The slow + constant progression
* Fun seeing the code slowly evolve and become more optimised
* Mostly seemless Liveshare session (only one crash!)
* Really liked the collaborative coding concept


What could be better
---

* Consider edge cases before the normal flow maybe? 
* Ensure the participants note their names instead of guests to save confusion
* 
* Play a theme song in the bg
* Probably codesandox instead of vscode

Actions for next time
---

* Use codesandbox/repl.it
* Could have used google colab or some other tool
* maybe go into/expose some FE work with js
* Probably codesandox instead of vscode
*
